We are a neuroscience lab at Mass Eye & Ear / Harvard Medical School studying the molecular genetics of auditory sensation and perception.

The world we inhabit as sentient beings is staggeringly complex and dynamic. How is our nervous system specialized to capture a slice of that vast sensory space most pertinent to us as a species? How do our senses adapt to reliably detect cues even as contexts fluctuate rapidly, or to meet varying sensation needs over an organism's life? Within the conceptual framework of these broad questions, our research program seeks to elucidate cellular and circuit-level features underlying faithful neural representation of ethologically relevant stimuli. To that end, we combine an array of modern molecular genetic tools with functional and behavioral assays to study relevant neural motifs in the mouse auditory system.

A major circuit feature of interest for the lab is cell type heterogeneity in the nervous system. Neuroscientists have been fascinated by it for centuries and continue to chart cell types and connectivity maps at unprecedented scale using modern tools and technologies. In our pursuits, we deliberately look beyond broad subdivisions such as excitatory vs inhibitory, motor vs sensory, efferent vs afferent, pyramidal vs purkinje and instead ask how diversity of closely-related neuronal types&mdash; those comprising a circuit node and often lumped into a singular class in coarse neural classification schemes&mdash;emerge developmentally and the computational benefit it imparts to neural circuits. Recent single cell transcriptomic studies confirm classical physiology-based insights that the nervous system is abound with this form of heterogeneity. We find sensory neurons particularly attractive in this regard for the opportunities offered to map discrete dimensions of neuronal feature variability onto qualitative or quantitative aspects of physical stimuli.

For this reason, our efforts are currently anchored on Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary sensory neurons of the auditory system. There are 3 molecular subtypes of Type I SGNs and little is known about how their identities are established during development. SGN diversity is thought to be crucial for sound intensity coding and the ability to hear in noisy environments, but direct experimental evidence has remained elusive due in part to inability to precisely target SGN subgroups. In our laboratory, we study molecular genetic mechanisms underlying diversity in the connectivity and physiological repertoires of SGNs, stability of their subtype-specific features over time, and significance of SGN subtype heterogeneity for sound sensation&mdash;and ultimately for perception. In doing so, we (1) generate and employ tools for spatiotemporally precise genetic access of SGNs; (2) read or perturb  their activity patterns; (3) chart their transcriptomic and gene regulatory landscapes by leveraging machine learning methods; and (4) measure changes in sound perception using operant-based behavioral assays. And we accomplish much of these using animal models in which gene expression is perturbed and neurons are molecularly tagged using adeno-associated viruses as well as CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

Across our scientific pursuits we strive to traverse multiple scales of inquiry, not only for tools and inspiration but also to generate integrated insights. We have a long-term interest in placing our studies in an evolutionary framework, asking how the developmental 'blueprint' encoded in the mouse genome may be implemented variably to produce ethologically suitable sensory abilites across species.
